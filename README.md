Team Epsilon's Orbital 2021 Project: My Study Buddy 

Deployment Link: http://msbud.herokuapp.com/

# Motivation:
We and the people around us have found it hard to make friends as classes continue to be shifted online and learning is to be done remotely. Even during the rare instances where we are able to go to campus to attend face to face lessons, the mandatory mask-on policy makes it almost impossible to smile at others and communicate freely. Our university experience has thus far been underwhelming and that is why we hope to create a platform for students in NUS to come together to:

1. Look for study buddies from similar course backgrounds
2. Pool in resources to aid learning/navigate through University
3. Look for suitable project mates to tackle projects in certain modules


# Aim:
We hope to create a platform that would allow NUS students to come together and create a more conducive environment and engaging experience for the student population in NUS.
