Team Epsilon's Orbital 2021 Project: My Study Buddy

# Motivation:
With remote learning becoming the new normal, we and the people around us have found it hard to make friends. Even during the rare instances where we are able to go to campus for face to face lessons, the mandatory mask-on policy makes it almost impossible to communicate freely or even smile at others. As a result of reduced social interactions, our university experience has been underwhelming thus far. That is why we hope to create a platform for students in NUS to come together to:

1. Look for study buddies from similar course backgrounds
2. Pool in resources to aid learning/navigate through University
3. Look for suitable project mates to tackle projects in certain modules


# Aim:
To encourage and facilitate social interaction, we hope to create a platform that would allow NUS students to come together and create a more conducive environment for both learning and socialising. We hope that such a platform would help supplement the palling student life in NUS.
